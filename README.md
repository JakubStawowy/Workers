# Workers
Simple workers database

This is my first project written in pure c++. It's main objective was to simulate the work of a local database. The data (worker objects) is stored in singly linked list (based on indicators). The data can be written and read from text file.

To proper work you must create text file named "data.txt" in the project folder
